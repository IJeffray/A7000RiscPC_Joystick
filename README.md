# Acorn A7000 / RiscPC Joystick 'NIC'

April 2025

A re-creation of the official (but not commercially released?) Acorn "1102,300" Joystick Adapter, for Acorn A7000 and RiscPC machines NIC slot.

On A7000 (only), this can support analog joysticks, as the ARM7500 SoC includes appropriate analog to digital converters, not found in the RiscPC.
